# Watering Dashboard backend

This is the backend part of the web server intended to monitor and control small terrace watering system. The idea is to use the dashboard to monitor soil moisture and to adjust watering pump settings or even to start watering manually if needed. Moisture and watering logs are stored to the database.

The backend is made in Vanilla JS using Node.js and Express. Sequalize is used for data models and SQLite for storage.
