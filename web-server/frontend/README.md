# Watering Dashboard frontend

This is the frontend part of the web server intended to monitor and control small terrace watering system. The idea is to use the dashboard to monitor soil moisture and to adjust watering pump settings or even to start watering manually if needed.

This project was created using the Vite template, with React and VanillaJS. TailwindCSS is used for styling. In development, communication with backend is mocked using Mock Service Worker.
