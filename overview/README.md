# Overview of my solution - TBD

This is a hobby project that started as idea to automate watering of small terrace garden with Raspberry Pi during vacation. It started from donated stuff (thanks to donors!) - Raspberry Pi 3B, Arduino Uno, ESP8266, some moisture sensors, relay, solvenoid valve, water pump.

More details coming...
